Application under construction. The main assumptions of this application is to convert video from h265 to h264 codec.
It depends on the windows platform, because here the playback of recordings in the h265 codec does not work, so it converts recordings to h264.

Files for testing are in the examples folder - grab and drop to the designated place.

The program is not completely finished. I try my best, I lack experience in organizing work with electron-boilerplate.
The project is not finished, I have a problem with ffmpeg and ffprobe modules, I am looking for information on how to export to all platforms. I have to add an icon, and remove the tab bar.

I hope that I will have time to write the recording export support. If that's not enough, I will understand stage 9 is good for me.
